**Virtual Robot in Gazebo world


This project is to Create a simulation world for Robots including models, World, Plugin for messgae communciation  using Gazebo

Base work:

2. Apply at least one feature, one color, and optionally one texture to the  structure. Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
3. Model any object of  choice using the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. Model links should be connected with joints.
4. Import your structure and two instances of your model inside an empty Gazebo World.
5.Import at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in your existing Gazebo world.
6. Write a C++ World Plugin to interact with your world. Your code should display “Welcome to Robotics Gazebo World!” message as soon as once launch the Gazebo world file.
